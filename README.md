BuzzFeed title:
## You Won't Believe What Candidates Did On This Technical Test

### Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
This is the coding test I've been using for almost a year now.
I'm updating it,
so I thought it would be interesting to share it with the World™.
We all know about the technical tests at big tech companies.
But, it's interesting to know how small startups approach it.

This has been my first experience as a Lead Front End dev _(and hiring manager)_, so I'm not pretending to have created the best test ever.
But, Le Test is drawn from my experience of being both sides of the interviewing desk, having had interviews at >10 companies _(big and small)_.

Establishing this extra step in the hiring process was controversial in the beginning for all the usual reasons:
- Good candidates can fail tests
- Bad candidates can pass tests
- blablabla

Without the red tape of larger businesses, we simply tried it, and we've been quite happy with it so far.

I think it's important to have your *own* test and not get one from THE internets because
the process of writing it helps you think about what you really want in a candidate.

Without further ado, you can [challenge yourself at the test](https://github.com/teawaterwire/le-test/blob/master/le-test.md), or cheat and [look at the answers](https://github.com/teawaterwire/le-test/blob/master/le-test-solution.md), or [read the debrief](https://github.com/teawaterwire/le-test/blob/master/le-test-debrief.md) if you've got too much time on your hands!

### Some bullet points for people who don't like prose

#### For which company?

- It's called [WorkAngel](https://www.workangel.com/). We build an employee engagement platform.
- It's a tech company (around 70 people at the time of commiting).
- I'm in charge of the Web Team.
- Javascript is our main technology.

#### Why a test?

- We need good Front-End engineers for the Web Team.
- We needed a way to efficiently filter out candidates that weren't technically sound.
- We didn't want a 4-hour test (because we already had one as an extra step of the process – if needed).
- We wanted something that resembled big tech companies' tests (they must be doing it for a reason).
- But easier (because pragmatism never hurts).

#### Live coding vs debriefing afterwards?

I did both.

I prefer putting people in a room and asking them questions after, because it's less stressful.
But, during interviews with foreign candidates, editing a live Google Doc over Skype worked as well.

#### Results?

This ended up being a 20-minute pencil&paper test consisting of 10 questions on practical JavaScript fundamentals.

As for how the candidates performed, nothing surprising here:
No matter how hard you're trying, you cannot fight against Carl Friedrich and his [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)!

#### Why updating it?

ES6 is here.
